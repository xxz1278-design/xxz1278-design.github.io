Purpose and Data Source\n\nThis dashboard uses public data from the NHANES (2017–2020) to establish a pre-pandemic cardiometabolic health baseline for the US adult population.

I integrated the key variables—demographics, BP, LDL, and Fasting Glucose, and then removed any missing values.\n\n### Clinical Risk Categorization\n\nTo enable clinically relevant epidemiological analysis, mean blood pressure and LDL level were converted into risk categories based on medical guidelines:\n\nBP Risk Staging: Categorized average BP into Normal, Elevated, Stage 1 Hypertension, and Stage 2 Hypertension.\n\nLDL Risk Staging: Categorized LDL levels into Optimal, Borderline, High Risk, and Very High Risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n## III.

The proportion of individuals in higher-risk LDL categories increases with age. \n\nB. There is an association between BP and gender.\n\nC. A positive correlation exists between LDL Cholesterol Level and Mean SBP.\n\nD.

Key Findings and Conclusions\n\n### Descriptive Findings\n\nHigh Prevalence: High-risk conditions are common, with **Hypertension at 41.9%** and **High Cholesterol at 25.8%**.\n\nRisk Distribution: Stage 2 Hypertension affects **20.7%** of the cohort, while over **a quarter** of individuals fall into the High Risk or Very High Risk LDL categories.\n\n### Correlational Analysis Findings:\n\n### A. LDL Risk Distribution by Age\n\nThe stacked bar chart presents an unexpected, non-linear relationship between age and LDL risk. While Young Adults (21-39) show the lowest Very High Risk prevalence, the data suggests that Middle-Aged Adults (40-59) are the group with the overall least favorable LDL profile, having the lowest proportion in the Optimal (<100) category. Older Adults (60+) surprisingly have the highest proportion of individuals in the Optimal category. I would interpret this as a result of widespread clinical management initiating after middle age — this age group is most likely to be receiving cholesterol medications, which shifts their LDL distribution back toward the optimal range. This highlights a limitation of using raw cross-sectional data without accounting for treatment effects.\n\n### B. Systolic BP Risk Distribution by Gender\n\nFemales have a significantly higher prevalence in the Normal BP category compared to males. While the most severe risk (Stage 2 Hypertension) is nearly equal, with a slight edge to males, the male population shows a larger overall representation in the non-optimal risk groups (Elevated, Stage 1, and Stage 2 combined). This indicates that females are generally more likely to maintain optimal blood pressure, while males are more frequently distributed across the various stages of hypertension and pre-hypertension.\n\n### C. LDL vs. Mean SBP\n\nPearson's r was very low at 0.0682. A minimal association suggests that BP and LDL tend to fluctuate independently in this population.\n\n### D. Mean SBP vs. Fasting Glucose\n\nPearson's r was 0.1645, indicating a weak-to-moderate positive correlation. This highlights the synergistic risk between elevated blood sugar and blood pressure, often seen in metabolic syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## V. Conclusion\n\nThis dashboard provides a data-driven understanding of the pre-pandemic cardiometabolic conditions.
