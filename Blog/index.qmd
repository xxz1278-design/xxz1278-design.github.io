# Baseline Analysis of Cardiometabolic Health Indicators

## I. Purpose and Data Source

This dashboard uses public data from the NHANES (2017–2020) to establish a pre-pandemic cardiometabolic health baseline for the US adult population. The focus is on key indicators: blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, and cholesterol levels (LDL), evaluating their prevalence and inter-relationships.





## II. Data Preparation and Processing

### Data Cleaning

I selected data for individuals aged 21 to 80 and calculated the mean of three repeated measurements for both Systolic (SBP) and Diastolic (DBP) pressure, a standard practice to obtain clinically stable BP values from the NHANES data. I integrated the key variables—demographics, BP, LDL, and Fasting Glucose, and then removed any missing values.

### Clinical Risk Categorization

To enable clinically relevant epidemiological analysis, mean blood pressure and LDL level were converted into risk categories based on medical guidelines:

BP Risk Staging: Categorized average BP into Normal, Elevated, Stage 1 Hypertension, and Stage 2 Hypertension.

LDL Risk Staging: Categorized LDL levels into Optimal, Borderline, High Risk, and Very High Risk.





## III. Hypotheses and Analyses


The analysis was structured into Descriptive Statistics and Correlational Analyses to test specific hypotheses:

### Descriptive Statistics

The purpose is to establish the baseline prevalence of high-risk states in the study population and provide insights for subsequent hypotheses and analyses.

### Hypotheses

A. The proportion of individuals in higher-risk LDL categories increases with age. 

B. There is an association between BP and gender.

C. A positive correlation exists between LDL Cholesterol Level and Mean SBP.

D. A positive correlation exists between Mean SBP and Fasting Glucose.

### Correlational Analyses

The purpose is to explore the strength and direction of associations between different health metrics and demographic factors.







## IV. Key Findings and Conclusions

### Descriptive Findings

High Prevalence: High-risk conditions are common, with **Hypertension at 41.9%** and **High Cholesterol at 25.8%**.

Risk Distribution: Stage 2 Hypertension affects **20.7%** of the cohort, while over **a quarter** of individuals fall into the High Risk or Very High Risk LDL categories.

### Correlational Analysis Findings:

### A. LDL Risk Distribution by Age

The stacked bar chart presents an unexpected, non-linear relationship between age and LDL risk. While Young Adults (21-39) show the lowest Very High Risk prevalence, the data suggests that Middle-Aged Adults (40-59) are the group with the overall least favorable LDL profile, having the lowest proportion in the Optimal (<100) category. Older Adults (60+) surprisingly have the highest proportion of individuals in the Optimal category. I would interpret this as a result of widespread clinical management initiating after middle age — this age group is most likely to be receiving cholesterol medications, which shifts their LDL distribution back toward the optimal range. This highlights a limitation of using raw cross-sectional data without accounting for treatment effects.

### B. Systolic BP Risk Distribution by Gender

Females have a significantly higher prevalence in the Normal BP category compared to males. While the most severe risk (Stage 2 Hypertension) is nearly equal, with a slight edge to males, the male population shows a larger overall representation in the non-optimal risk groups (Elevated, Stage 1, and Stage 2 combined). This indicates that females are generally more likely to maintain optimal blood pressure, while males are more frequently distributed across the various stages of hypertension and pre-hypertension.

### C. LDL vs. Mean SBP

Pearson's r was very low at 0.0682. A minimal association suggests that BP and LDL tend to fluctuate independently in this population.

### D. Mean SBP vs. Fasting Glucose

Pearson's r was 0.1645, indicating a weak-to-moderate positive correlation. This highlights the synergistic risk between elevated blood sugar and blood pressure, often seen in metabolic syndrome.






## V. Conclusion

This dashboard provides a data-driven understanding of the pre-pandemic cardiometabolic conditions. The key takeaway is the high baseline prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and the observed synergistic effect between blood pressure and blood glucose.
