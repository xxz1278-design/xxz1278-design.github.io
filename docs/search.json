I’m Xinyin, and I’m currently a Master of Science student in Pathology at Case Western Reserve University.\nAfter earning my MBBS degree in China, I came to CWRU to pursue my goal of a pathology residency. My coursework, including Statistical Methods (R), is helping me prepare for this next step. I’ve also had some incredible clinical experiences that have deepened my passion for this field.\nI’m excited to share my work and journey with you. Thanks for stopping by!"

    "text": "This dashboard uses public data from the NHANES (2017–2020) to establish a pre-pandemic cardiometabolic health baseline for the US adult population. The focus is on key indicators: blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, and cholesterol levels (LDL), evaluating their prevalence and inter-relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nI selected data for individuals aged 21 to 80 and calculated the mean of three repeated measurements for both Systolic (SBP) and Diastolic (DBP) pressure, a standard practice to obtain clinically stable BP values from the NHANES data. I integrated the key variables—demographics, BP, LDL, and Fasting Glucose, and then removed any missing values.\n\n\n\nTo enable clinically relevant epidemiological analysis, mean blood pressure and LDL level were converted into risk categories based on medical guidelines:\nBP Risk Staging: Categorized average BP into Normal, Elevated, Stage 1 Hypertension, and Stage 2 Hypertension.\nLDL Risk Staging: Categorized LDL levels into Optimal, Borderline, High Risk, and Very High Risk.\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis was structured into Descriptive Statistics and Correlational Analyses to test specific hypotheses:\n\n\nThe purpose is to establish the baseline prevalence of high-risk states in the study population and provide insights for subsequent hypotheses and analyses.\n\n\n\nA. The proportion of individuals in higher-risk LDL categories increases with age.\nB. There is an association between BP and gender.\nC. A positive correlation exists between LDL Cholesterol Level and Mean SBP.\nD. A positive correlation exists between Mean SBP and Fasting Glucose.\n\n\n\nThe purpose is to explore the strength and direction of associations between different health metrics and demographic factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Prevalence: High-risk conditions are common, with Hypertension at 41.9% and High Cholesterol at 25.8%.\nRisk Distribution: Stage 2 Hypertension affects 20.7% of the cohort, while over a quarter of individuals fall into the High Risk or Very High Risk LDL categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart presents an unexpected, non-linear relationship between age and LDL risk. While Young Adults (21-39) show the lowest Very High Risk prevalence, the data suggests that Middle-Aged Adults (40-59) are the group with the overall least favorable LDL profile, having the lowest proportion in the Optimal (&lt;100) category. Older Adults (60+) surprisingly have the highest proportion of individuals in the Optimal category. I would interpret this as a result of widespread clinical management initiating after middle age — this age group is most likely to be receiving cholesterol medications, which shifts their LDL distribution back toward the optimal range. This highlights a limitation of using raw cross-sectional data without accounting for treatment effects.\n\n\n\nFemales have a significantly higher prevalence in the Normal BP category compared to males. While the most severe risk (Stage 2 Hypertension) is nearly equal, with a slight edge to males, the male population shows a larger overall representation in the non-optimal risk groups (Elevated, Stage 1, and Stage 2 combined). This indicates that females are generally more likely to maintain optimal blood pressure, while males are more frequently distributed across the various stages of hypertension and pre-hypertension.\n\n\n\nPearson’s r was very low at 0.0682. A minimal association suggests that BP and LDL tend to fluctuate independently in this population.\n\n\n\nPearson’s r was 0.1645, indicating a weak-to-moderate positive correlation. This highlights the synergistic risk between elevated blood sugar and blood pressure, often seen in metabolic syndrome.\n\n\n\n\nThis dashboard provides a data-driven understanding of the pre-pandemic cardiometabolic conditions. The key takeaway is the high baseline prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and the observed synergistic effect between blood pressure and blood glucose.",
